# About
In this project we analyzed the Barabási–Albert (BA) model, a network growth model based on preferential attachment. 

# Contents
* Network Generation: Simulated, visualized and examined overall network behavior of the Barabási–Albert (BA) models for various parameters *n* (number of nodes) and *m* (number of new edges)
* Statistical Metrics: We calculated key network metrics, including degree distribution, clustering coefficient, and average path length for different BA graphs 
* Network Analysis: We explored the relationship between node degree and network growth, as well as the influence of parameter variation on network topology
* Comparison: Compared networks generated under different conditions and analyzed how variations in parameters affect the overall properties of the generated network.
* Also examined: Relationships between node degree and network metrics (e.g., clustering coefficient, average path length), examination of how the growth of the network impacts the node distribution over time...

# Requirements
Python with `networkX`, `matplotlib` and `numpy` libraries.
